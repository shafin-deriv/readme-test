  <h4>Core Concepts</h4>
</RenderOfficialContents>

<RenderOfficialContents>
    Have a look at the <a href='/docs/category/core-concepts'>Core concepts</a> pages and take your
    time to read through it. These concepts will help you get familiar with our WebSocket server api
    and how to use it more efficiently. They are not related to any of our frameworks or libraries.
</RenderOfficialContents>

<RenderOfficialContents>
    When you read through the <a href='/docs/category/core-concepts'>Core concepts</a> page, you can
    start choosing your implementation approach based on the language, framework or library you want
    to use in your application.
</RenderOfficialContents>

<h4>Code Examples</h4>

If you want to know how you can implement our API within your code, then we suggest to have a look  
at our <a href='/docs/category/code-examples'>Code examples</a>. These code examples come in  
`CodeSandboxes`. This allows you to easily fork the code examples and experiment with them for  
personal use. For now we only have JavaScript code examples, but, we plan to add more examples  
that are created with different languages, frameworks and libraries in the near future.

<RenderOfficialContents>
  <h4>Languages</h4>
</RenderOfficialContents>

<RenderOfficialContents>
    When using our code examples, we also suggest to have a look at our{' '}
    <a href='/docs/category/languages'>Languages</a> section. Here, we describe in detail how you
    can setup your personal project properly to make use of our API. This will surely come helpful
    when you try to integrate some of our code examples in your own project.

<RenderOfficialContents>
  <h4>Guides</h4>
</RenderOfficialContents>

<RenderOfficialContents>
    If you want to know for example how you can `monetize your application` or how to create a
    `secure way for users to log in` to your application, then we provide a handful of{' '}
    <a href='/docs/category/guides'>Guides</a> that can assist you with that.
</RenderOfficialContents>

  <h4>Setting up a Deriv application</h4>
</RenderOfficialContents>

<RenderOfficialContents>
    If you want to know more about the essentials that are needed to setup your own application,
    then have a look at the{' '}
    <a href='/docs/setting-up-a-deriv-application'>Setting up a Deriv application</a> section.
