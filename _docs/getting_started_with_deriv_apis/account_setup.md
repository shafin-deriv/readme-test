> ðŸ“˜ Tips:
> 
> 1. **Never share the token publicly**
> 2. You can revoke or delete tokens anytime in the "Manage Tokens" tab.
> 3. You can also create API tokens directly through the Deriv API using OAuth2. This method is useful for scripts or applications that create programmatic tokens.

## Register your DERIV Application

1. Open  the **Dashboard** and select the **Register Application** Tab.
2. Choose the API Token you want to use.
3. Provide a **Name** for your application.
4. Add the **Markup fee**.
   > ðŸ“˜ Note:
   > 
   > Markup is the commission added to the trade price to earn additional income.  
   > More details on markup calculation are available here.
5. Fill in OAuth details:
   1. Authorisation URL: This URL enables your users to log in to your app using their Deriv accounts without an API token.
   2. Verification URL:  The OAuth redirect URL for the OAuth authorisation.  
      For example, if your domain is  `<https://example.com>`and your **authorisation and authentication** are handled by `verfiy`, your URLs will be:  
      `https://example.com/verify`
6. **Select** the authorization scope and click **Create**.

Your app will now be available under the **Manage Applications** tab.
